## Concepts Learned

To create this "Bun on the Run" menu app the following JavaScript concepts were used:
- variables let vs const
- _______________
- _______________
- _______________
- _______________
- _______________
- _______________
- _______________
- _______________
- _______________

## How I made the web app

1. First I defined a const called menus and assigned it to be an empty array
    ```js
    const menus = []
    ```
    The reason why I did that is because the menus array will eventually be assigned an array of objects where each object represents a daily menu, complete with menu items and prices.

1. Next I ______________________________
    ```js
    let currentIndex = 0;
    ```
    The reason why I did that is because ______________________________________


1. Next I defined _____________________________________
    ```js
    const menuTitle = document.querySelector("#menu h2");
    ```
    The reason why I did that is because ________________________________

1. Next I defined a _______________________________
    ```js
    function display(todaysmenu) {
        menuTitle.textContent = todaysmenu.title;
        soup.title.textContent = todaysmenu.soup;
        soup.price.textContent = todaysmenu.soupPrice;
        ...etc...
    }
    ```
    This function displays the current menu.  For exammple, it displays the menu title by ________________________________

1. Next I defined a function called getJson which will fetch our menus data in JSON format
    ```js
    async function init() {
        const res = await fetch("____________________________");
        const data = await res.json();
        menu.push(...data);
        display(menu[currentIndex]);
    }
    ```
    First I defined a constant called res which will be assigned ____________________________________

    Next I defined a const called data which is assigned ______________________________.

    Next I inserted that entire array of objects into our menus array by ________________________.  

    Next I called the function display to display our current menu passing in the argument of our first menu in our array

1.  Next I defined a function called prev which takes no parameter but decrements our currentIndex by 1 then calls our display function
    ```js
    function prev() {
        currentIndex = currentIndex === 0 ? menu.length - 1 : currentIndex - 1;
        display(menu[currentIndex]);
    }
    ```
    The reason I'm manipulating the value of currentIndex is ____________________

1.  In similar fashion, I also created a function called next with similar logic.
    ```js
    function next() {
        currentIndex = currentIndex === menu.length - 1 ? 0 : currentIndex + 1;
        display(menu[currentIndex]);
    }
    ```

1.  Next I added some click event listeners to both next and previous buttons
    ```js
    previousMenu.addEventListener("click", prev);
    nextMenu.addEventListener("click", next);
    ```
    The reason for adding click event handlers is so that ________________________

1.  Finally, I __________________________
    ```js
    init();
    ```

# Reflection
## What is the hardest part of creating this web app?

## What remaining JS concepts are still kind of foggy?

## Deck of cards API (remnant of Assignment 4)
Given the documentation listed here: https://deckofcardsapi.com/ it lists 2 APIs/REST endpoints `Shuffle the Cards` and `Draw a card`.  What would you need to do to draw 1 card?
